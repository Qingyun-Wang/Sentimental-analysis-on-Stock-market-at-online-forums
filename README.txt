This web application represents a comprehensive project that I have personally developed, encompassing all stages from the initial conceptualization and idea generation to data acquisition, model construction, and deployment. It offers a sophisticated sentiment analysis tool tailored for the top 100 largest companies in the stock market.

Specifically designed to cater to users seeking to understand prevailing sentiments about these companies in online forums, this application currently focuses on data from Reddit. It features an intuitive interface where users can select a company of interest, and with a simple click of a button, they are presented with a detailed graphical representation of the sentiment trends over time.

Moreover, this application not only saves a significant amount of time for the user but also provides an objective view of the prevailing mood in the stock market. This tool is particularly valuable for those who aim to gauge public opinion and online discussions surrounding major market players, offering insights that are critical in today's data-driven decision-making processes.
