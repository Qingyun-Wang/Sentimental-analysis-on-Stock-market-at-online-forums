[This web application](https://stockforumsentimentanalysis.onrender.com), represents a comprehensive project that I have personally developed, encompassing all stages from the initial conceptualization and idea generation to data acquisition, model construction, and deployment. It offers a sophisticated sentiment analysis tool tailored for public discussions of the top 100 largest companies in the stock market.

This project addresses the challenging and often time-consuming task of discerning public sentiment towards leading companies as reflected in online forums. Itâ€™s designed for individuals who are keen to gauge the public sentiment with personal investment in stock market. The final product is a web application that allows users to input companies of interest and receive a line graph depicting sentiment trends over a user-specified period. This is benchmarked against the general sentiment towards the top 100 companies. Additionally, the app provides an overview of current sentiment across these companies, offering a snapshot of market perception and identifying the most favored large companies in online forums.

This tool is particularly valuable for those who aim to gauge public opinion and online discussions surrounding major market players, offering insights that are critical in today's data-driven decision-making processes.
